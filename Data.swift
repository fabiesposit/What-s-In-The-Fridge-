Tender salmon fillets are seasoned with herbs, grilled to perfection, and finished with a bright and zesty lemon herb butter sauce.Begin by preheating the grill to medium-high heat. Season salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and a mixture of chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, dill, and thyme. Grill the salmon for 4-5 minutes per side, or until it flakes easily with a fork. While the salmon is grilling, prepare the lemon herb butter sauce by melting butter in a small saucepan. Stir in minced garlic, lemon zest, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Cook until fragrant and slightly thickened. Remove the grilled salmon from the grill and drizzle with the lemon herb butter sauce. Serve immediately, garnished with additional fresh herbs and lemon slices. This grilled salmon with lemon herb butter is delicious served alongside grilled vegetables or a crisp green salad.",
